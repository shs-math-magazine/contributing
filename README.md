## General Guidelines

If you are familiar with LaTeX typesetting, please do us a favor and write your article in LaTeX. You can share it with us through [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), Google Drive, or by emailing us the `.tex` file and any other relevant files. *Please also see our [LaTeX Guidelines]() to make the process of adding your article easier for us.*

You can write about anything math-related! This includes traditional mathematics subjects (including geometry, algebra, graph theory, number theory, and calculus), but can also include applied mathematics and mathematics-adjacent topics, such as computer science, math history, and physics, just to name a few.

## Submission Formatting

Please keep the title of your article to fewer than 60 characters. Fewer than 50 is preferred. If your title is too long, we will modify it.

When it comes to diagrams, please keep in mind that the physical copies of the magazine will be printed in black and white. The diagrams will be resized to a width of 8 centimeters *at maximum*. Please make sure that all text (such as labels or captions) is legible.

All diagrams that you include (`.jpg`, `.png`, and any other media files) *must* be sent along with your article. If you submit a Google Doc, please email the diagrams to us separately. Please title all such files as `firstinitial_lastname_imagenumber` (for example, `a_liang_2.png` would be the second diagram in Aiden Liang's article).
